🧑‍💻 Master Prompt for Building EduVoice AI

Build me a modern Progressive Web App (PWA) called “EduVoice AI” – a next-generation AI learning assistant that is voice-first, visual, and interactive.

🎯 Core Features
1. Voice-First AI Tutor

A floating 🎤 mic button to start recording.

Speech-to-Text (Whisper API) for user input.

AI response in both text + natural voice (TTS like ElevenLabs/PlayHT).

Example Flow:

User: “Explain Newton’s Laws like I’m 12”

AI: Speaks + shows visual diagram on canvas.

2. Visual Learning Canvas (Core USP – better than Kuse.ai)

Interactive drag-and-drop canvas (like Excalidraw / Miro style).

Users can upload PDFs, images, YouTube links, or text notes.

AI extracts concepts and auto-generates mind maps, flowcharts, and connections between topics.

Example:

Input: “Photosynthesis PDF + Biology Lecture Video”

Canvas Output: AI links sunlight → chlorophyll → glucose → oxygen, with visual nodes.

Canvas supports:

Zoom & Pan

Export to PNG/PDF

AI commands: “Show how X relates to Y”.

3. Smart Test Generator

AI detects user weak areas from past questions/doubts.

Generates MCQs, quizzes, or practice sheets automatically.

Option to export/download test as PDF.

Example:

User: “Give me 5 questions on Trigonometry from today’s study”

AI generates quiz with answers.

4. Multi-Modal Input

📸 Upload image or handwritten notes → AI solves problems step-by-step.

📑 Upload PDFs → AI summarizes chapters + creates test questions.

🎥 YouTube/lecture video link → AI extracts key timestamps + summary.

✍️ AI handwriting recognition for math/physics problems.

5. Personalized AI Teacher

Saves user profile, progress, learning style.

AI adapts answers (kid mode, college level, advanced learner).

For Teachers: Generate lesson plans, share visual canvases, track student progress.

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements

Clean, futuristic student-friendly UI.

Dark / Light mode toggle.

Layout:

Sidebar: uploaded materials (PDFs, videos, notes).

Main Area: Visual Canvas.

Bottom Panel: Chat interface (text + voice).

Floating 🎤 Mic button for instant “Ask AI”.

Export options: PDF, PNG, Quiz.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + Canvas library (Konva.js or Excalidraw clone).

Voice: Whisper API (STT) + ElevenLabs/PlayHT (TTS).

Backend: Node.js + Python AI microservices.

AI Models:

GPT/Claude → explanations & quizzes

Vision model (Claude Vision / Gemini Vision) → images & videos

Database: MongoDB (user data, uploads, quizzes) + Redis (cache).

Realtime: WebSockets for voice + canvas updates.

💰 Monetization Hooks

Free Tier: Limited queries, basic canvas.

Student Pro (₹499/month): Unlimited AI queries + quizzes.

Teacher Pro (₹999/month): Lesson planning + analytics.

Stripe/Razorpay placeholders for payment gateway.
